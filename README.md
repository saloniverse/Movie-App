> _by Saloni_

This webpage titled Movie App is made using React. It is a simple movie generating app, where you enter movie name or keywords in the search bar and you'll get movie suggestions with the name. Also, if you click on any one of the suggested movie, you'll get details about that particular movie on the screen.
